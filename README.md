# Plant_Disease_Classification

Plant diseases can significantly affect crop yield and quality, making their early detection crucial for farmers and agricultural experts. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify plant diseases based on leaf images. The classification is done using various deep learning techniques, primarily focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
